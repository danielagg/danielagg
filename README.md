I am passionate about researching adaptable sofware architectures, enabling applications to gracefully evolve over time. I have learnt over time that as business needs change and technology advances, having an architecture that can accommodate change is extremely important, but often neglected. As of 2023, I am a preacher of modular monoliths, Domain Driven Design and compartmentalizing volatile parts of applications, rather than religiously de-coupling them by functionality. As much as I enjoy geeking out over architectures, I like to think that I am pragmatic, always keeping in mind that my goal as a software developer is to deliver a working product, not the blueprint of it.

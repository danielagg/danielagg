I advocate for modular monoliths with vertical slicing, Domain Driven Design, true CI/CD with Trunk Based Development and feature flags, fitness functions, procedural code and compartmentalizing volatile parts of our applications, rather than dogmatically de-couple by functionality/requirement.

I'm passionate about researching adaptable sofware architectures, enabling applications to gracefully evolve over time. I came to realize that in the ever-changing landscape of business needs and technological advances, having an adaptable architecture is crucial, providing the advantage of keeping the tempo of development rapid, without accumulating considerable technical debt. Yet, it remains common to not pay attention to plan and consistently maintain the architecture of our applications.

While I love geeking out over architectures, I like to think that I'm also pragmatic, always keeping in mind that my goal as a software developer is to deliver a working product, not the blueprint of it.

I advocate for modular monoliths with vertical slicing, Domain Driven Design, true CI/CD with Trunk Based Development and feature flags, fitness functions, procedural code and compartmentalizing volatile parts of our applications.

I'm passionate about researching adaptable software architectures, enabling applications to gracefully evolve over time: I came to realize the value of an adaptable architecture, which can facilitate the ever-changing landscape of business needs and keep the tempo of development rapid, without accumulating technical debt.

While I love geeking out over architectures, I like to think that I'm also pragmatic, always keeping in mind that my goal as a software developer is to deliver a working product, not the blueprint of it.
